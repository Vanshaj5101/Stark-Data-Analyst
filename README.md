## How to create your own slackbot

To integrate the slack bot, there are 4 important components:
1. Python Environment and Code Setup
2. Slack Setup
3. OpenAI API Configuration
4. Hosting & Testing


### 1. Python Environment and Code Setup

#### -- Clone the Repository

Begin by cloning the repository from GitHub:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Vanshaj5101/Stark-Data-Analyst.git
cd Stark-Data-Analyst
```

The repository contains the following key files:

**Quart_app.py**: The main Python file that holds the Quart application to manage Slack events.
**slack_bot_handler.py**: Contains all the bot logic. Events received by Quart_app.py are processed here to interpret user requirements and provide outputs.
**FetchUserId.py**: A utility script to fetch the Slack bot's user ID.
**requirements.txt**: Lists all dependencies for the project.
**data.csv**:A dummy dataset for testing the bot's data analysis functionality.

After cloning the repo, first configure environment variables and virtual environment

#### -- Configure Environment Variables
Create a .env file in the project directory with the following structure: 
(we will look into steps to get values for all the environment variables, for now have this structure copied and pasted as .env file)
```
SLACK_BOT_TOKEN=<your-slack-bot-token>
SLACK_BOT_USER_ID=<your-slack-bot-user-id>
OPEN_AI_API_KEY=<your-openai-api-key>
WEB_TOKEN=<your-web-token>
```

#### -- Setup Python Virtual Environment

```
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```
Install required dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


## Slack Setup

Follow these steps to configure the Slack app:

### Step 1: Create a Slack App
1. Visit [Slack API Apps](https://api.slack.com/apps).

2. Under **Scopes**, add the following bot token scopes:
   - `app_mentions:read`
   - `channels:history`
   - `chat:write`
   - `chat:write.public`
   - `files:read`
   - `incoming-webhook`

### Step 3: Install the App
1. Go to the **Install App** section in the left-hand menu.
2. Click **Install App to Workspace**.
3. Copy the **OAuth Token** from the app after installation and update your `.env` file:
   ```env
   SLACK_BOT_TOKEN=<your-slack-bot-token>

### Step 4: Get Web Token
1. Go to the **Basic Information** section in the left-hand menu.
2. Scroll down to **App-Level Tokens** section.
3. Click **Generate Token**
4. Enter following details:
